# Data Cleaning

Data needs to be tabular: 

* Remove empty rows
* Remove empty columns
* Every column has to have a column header
* Replace the missing value characters (e.g., `NA`, `NaN`, `n/a`) with empty values, i.e., remove them
* Numbers should use decimal with dots "." (Note: for some European regions, Excel will use the comma `,` for decimals
* Numbers should not have commas in them
