# Data Cleaning

Here are the primary considerations.

* Make sure data has a tabular Structure
* Make sure data has the proper format for Numbers
* Make sure missing values are kept empty

## Tabular
Data needs to be tabular.

* No empty rows 
* No empty columns
* Every column has to have a column header

## Number Formats

* Numbers should use decimal with dots "." (Note: for some European regions, Excel will use the comma `,` for decimals
* Numbers should not have commas in them

## Missing values

* Replace the missing value characters (e.g., `NA`, `NaN`, `n/a`) with empty values, i.e., remove them
